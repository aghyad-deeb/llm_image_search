# LLM Image Search

## What this is
LLMs currently appear to lack the ability to properly search for images. The match the keywords to the images primitivley without actually looking at the image. This is a simple application that allows the LLM to look at the image and if the image matches the description, it's returned to the user, otherwise the search continues.

## Setup
In order to use this, you need Pillow and dotenv packages. Then create a `.env`
file with your Google Custom Search Engine ID, Google Cloud API Key, and 
OpenAI API Key. Here are the steps to crate the former two keys:

### Google Custom Search Engine ID
Go to [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all)
Click "Add" to create a new search engine
In "Sites to search", enter * (asterisk) to search the entire web
Give your search engine a name (e.g., "My Image Search")
In the search engine settings, enable "Image search" option
Click "Create"
Copy the Search engine ID - you'll need this for configuration

### Google Cloud API Key
Go to [Google Cloud Console API Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
If you don't have a project, create one
Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" â†’ "API key"
Copy the generated API key
(Optional) Restrict the API key to "Custom Search API" for security

After getting the keys, create a `.env` file with:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj...

CSE_ID=...

GOOGLE_API_KEY=AI...


## Usage
Run `python main.py` and you'll be prompted for the image description.
